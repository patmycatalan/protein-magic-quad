# Protein Bar Magic Quadrant

See [blog post](https://alexcatalanflores.com/protein-bar-magic-quad/) this was made for.

## Overview
This repository contains an interactive visualization that helps compare protein bars based on two key metrics:

- **Protein Density**: The percentage of calories derived from protein
- **Protein Economy**: The amount of protein per price (adjusted for weight)

The visualization uses a "Magic Quadrant" format to plot protein bar brands across these dimensions, allowing consumers to identify which products offer the best nutritional value for money.

## The Quadrants
The visualization divides protein bars into four categories:
- Pound for Pount Champs
- Finance Bro Fundamentals
- Functional Fuelers
- Swole Survivors

## Interactive Features
The visualization includes several interactive elements:

- Brand Labels: Each data point is labeled with its brand name
- Hover Information: Hovering over a data point displays detailed metrics
- Visual Cues: Data points change appearance on hover to enhance usability

## Implementation Details
The visualization is built using:

- HTML/CSS: For structure and styling
- JavaScript: For data processing and interactive elements
- SVG: For rendering the chart components

The data is embedded directly in the JavaScript file for simplicity, though it could be modified to load from external sources.

## How to Use
1. Visit the GitHub Pages deployment at https://yourusername.github.io/protein-bar-chart/
2. Or clone this repository and open index.html in any modern browser

## Customization
You can easily customize this visualization:

- Change the data: Edit the CSV string in script.js
- Modify the appearance: Adjust styles in styles.css
- Change quadrant labels: Edit the label text in both HTML and JavaScript files

## Original Data Source
The data for this visualization was compiled from nutritional information and pricing of commercially available protein bars in the UK market. The analysis focuses on objective metrics rather than subjective qualities like taste or texture.
